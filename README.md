A text adventure game with plenty of twists and turns! Pay attention to all the clues!


Explanations of the technologies used
I used an array of so bjects to store Room titles and Room descriptions as well as to distribute those values throughout my game. Also, I made major use of local storage which help to block the player from either advancing if they did not have the item in their LS! Alerts were also present to help the player keep track of what they had in their inventory! Also, had to really be careful not to let the user advance to certain rooms without completing certain actions. Two death scenarios, one alternate ending scenario, one win scenario.

Approach taken
This project initially started off smaller than what I ended up doing. I actually expanded on how many rooms I initially had and therefore in order to continue I ended up making a flowchart of gameplay. This flowchart REALLY helped me stay organized and get things done with precision! As I completed steps of the game I then tested each scenario available, just to make every situation worked.

User stories
I had several people play it and a lot of the feedback was that they loved it and it was pretty difficult to actually win. I would say that the people who played wanted another win situation, I feel like I can expand on that.

Wireframes
My initial wireframe is still pretty close to what I actually ended up executing, the title of the game, a photo in the background relevant to where player is in the game, text filled with the story, and two--four buttons for choices.
