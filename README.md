### Description

A choose your own adventure game. You've ended up in some spooky woodland area, try to find your way out without running into trouble. Pay attention to all the clues!

### Tech Used

Using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery I've decided to make this awesome choose your own adventure type of game. I also messed around with local storage and that is a main part of the game's functionality.

### Approach taken

This project initially started off smaller than what I ended up doing. I actually expanded on how many rooms I initially had and therefore in order to continue I ended up making a flowchart of gameplay. This flowchart REALLY helped me stay organized and get things done with precision! As I completed steps of the game I then tested each scenario available, just to make every situation worked.

### User stories

I had several people play it and a lot of the feedback was that they loved it and it was pretty difficult to actually win. I would say that the people who played wanted another win situation, I feel like I can expand on that.

### Wireframes

My initial wireframe is still pretty close to what I actually ended up executing, the title of the game, a photo in the background relevant to where player is in the game, text filled with the story, and two--four buttons for choices.

### How-to-use instructions
Enter your name to begin your journey...pay attention to the clues in the story! your choices are important in whether you win or lose!
